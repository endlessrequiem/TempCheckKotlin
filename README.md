# TempCheckKotlin
Remake of my first Android app, done in Kotlin; This Android app tells you if your body temperature is within the normal range for Fahrenheit, Celsius, and Kelvin. 

# What it does
Nothing special, you input your temperature and it'll tell you if it is normal

# Why I made it
This was my first attempt at a Kotlin Android App, just trying out Kotlin
